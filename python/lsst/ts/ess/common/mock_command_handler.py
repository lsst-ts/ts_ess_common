class MockCommandHandler(AbstractCommandHandler):
    """Handle incoming commands and send replies. Apply configuration and read
    sensor data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    callback: `Callable`
        The callback coroutine handling the sensor telemetry. This can be a
        coroutine that sends the data via a socket connection or a coroutine in
        a test class to verify that the command has been handled correctly.
    simulation_mode: `int`
        Indicating if a simulation mode (> 0) or not (0) is active.
    name: `str`
        The name used for the mock telemetry.

    The commands that can be handled are:

        configure: Load the configuration that is passed on with the command
        and connect to the devices specified in that configuration. This
        command can be sent multiple times before a start is received and only
        the last configuration is kept.
        start: Start reading the sensor data of the connected devices and send
        it as plain text via the socket. If no configuration was sent then the
        start command is ignored. Once started no configuration changes can be
        done anymore.
        stop: Stop sending sensor data and disconnect from all devices. Once
        stopped, configuration changes can be done again and/or reading of
        sensor data can be started again.
