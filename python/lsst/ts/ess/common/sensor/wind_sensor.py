    Perform protocol conversion for Gill Windsonic Ultrasonic Anemometer
    instruments. The instrument is assumed to use its default message format -
    "Gill - Polar, Continuous" as documented in Gill Windsonic Doc No 1405 PS
    0019 Issue 28.
    Serial data is output by the anemometer once per second with the following
    format:

        '<STX>Q,ddd,sss.ss,M,00,<ETX>checksum<CR><LF>'

    where:

        <STX>       ASCII start character.
        'Q'         Unit Identifier ('Q' is default value).
        ddd         Wind direction. Three character, leading zero's integer.
                    000-359 degrees. Wind direction value is empty ('') when
                    wind speed is below 0.05 m/s.
        sss.ss      Wind speed. Six character, floating point, leading zero's.
                    0 to 60 m/s.
        'M'         Unit of speed measurement ('M' is m/s default)
        '00'        Status.

        checksum    Exclusive OR of all bytes in the string between <STX> and
                    <ETX> characters.
        <CR><LF>    2-character terminator ('\r\n').

    ----------
    log : `logger`
