class DeviceConfig:
    """Configuration for a device.

    Parameters
    ----------
    name : `str`
        The name of the device.
    sens_type : `SensorType`
        The type of sensor.
    baud_rate : `int`
        The baud rate of the sensor.
    location: `str`
        The location of the device.
    dev_type : `DeviceType`, optional
        The type of device, or None in case of a TCP/IP device.
    dev_id : `str`
        The ID of the device, or None in case of a TCP/IP device.
    num_channels : `int`, optional
        The number of channels the output data, or 0 indicating that the number
        of channels is not configurable for this type of device. Defaults to 0.
    num_samples : `int`, optional
        The number of samples to accumulate before reporting telemetry.
        Only relevant for sensors that report statistics, such as anemometers.
        For those sensors the value must be > 1, and preferably larger.
        For other sensors use the default value of 0.
    safe_interval : `int`, optional
        The number of seconds to sleep before an event is sent indicating that
        a previously sent event is over. Defaults to 0.
    threshold : `float`, optional
        A threshold value that can be used to, for instance, determine if an
        event needs to be sent. Defaults to 0.0.
    host : `str`, optional
        The host to connect to in case of a device that provides telemetry via
        a TCP/IP connection, or None in case of a local device.
    port : `int`, optional
        The port to connect to in case of a device that provides telemetry via
        a TCP/IP connection, or None in case of a local device.

    Notes
    -----
    In case dev_type and dev_id are None then host and port cannot be None.
